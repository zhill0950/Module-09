# Module-09

## Description

For this project I was tasked with building a weather dashboard application that calls the OpenWeather API and renders data in the browser.

Unfortunately, I had an extremely rough time with this project and was unsuccessful in completing it. None of my code seems to function properly. Will have to come back and figure this lesson out!
